What is Process Herpaderping?

Process Herpaderping is a sneaky way for malware to hide. It runs bad code in memory while making it look like a safe file on disk. The attacker creates a process from a file, then changes or deletes that file before the process actually starts. This tricks security tools — they see a clean file or no file, while the bad code runs quietly in memory.

👉 Key point: What’s on disk looks safe, but what’s running in memory is not.

🚀 How it works (simple steps)

1️⃣ A fake or random file is written to disk with the bad code.
       ↓
2️⃣ A process is created using that file (Windows loads it into memory).
       ↓
3️⃣ The file on disk is changed or deleted before the process starts running.
       ↓
4️⃣ The process runs bad code, but the file on disk looks harmless or is gone.

✅ Windows keeps running the bad code that was loaded into memory — it doesn’t check the changed file again.

💡 Easy Analogy

It’s like giving someone a book full of dangerous ideas to read. Before anyone else checks the book, you swap the pages with harmless ones or throw it away. The person still has those dangerous ideas, but others see a safe or empty book.

🛡 Detection logic

🕵️ Compare the process memory image with the file on disk → check for mismatches.

🕵️ Alert if a file is changed or deleted within seconds of being used to create a process.

🕵️ Correlate process creation events + file modification or deletion + image load anomalies.

Example tool usage: use tools like Sysmon, Volatility, or PE-sieve to detect these anomalies.


🔑 Why does it bypass AV/EDR?

✅ Antivirus tools often scan the file on disk or the file loaded at process start. Since the file on disk looks harmless or no longer exists, the tools are tricked. They don’t inspect the mapped memory deeply after the file has changed.

✅ Traditional file reputation checks and signatures fail because the file hash no longer matches the running code.
