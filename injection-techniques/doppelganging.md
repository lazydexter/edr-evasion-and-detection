# Process Doppelg√§nging

üí° **Summary:**  
Process Doppelg√§nging is a stealthy code injection technique that combines elements of process hollowing with fileless execution via Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF).  
It allows attackers to run malicious payloads in memory without ever dropping a malicious file on disk.

## üß† Key Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create Transaction (TxF)**  
- The attacker opens a Windows file system transaction (`CreateTransaction`).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create and Write Malicious PE to Transacted File**  
- The attacker writes a PE image into a file within this transaction (`CreateFileTransacted`, `WriteFile`).  
- The file is not visible on disk.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create Section Object**  
- The malicious PE is mapped into memory using `NtCreateSection`.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Rollback Transaction**  
- The transaction is rolled back (`RollbackTransaction`), deleting the file but leaving the section object in memory.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Create Suspended Legitimate Process**  
- A clean process is started in suspended mode (`CreateProcess` with `CREATE_SUSPENDED`).

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Map Malicious Section into Process**  
- The malicious section is mapped (`NtMapViewOfSection`).

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Resume Process**  
- The process resumes, now running malicious code (`ResumeThread`).

## üîç Detection Ideas

- **TxF API abuse:** Rare in modern legitimate software ‚Äî look for `CreateTransaction`, `CreateFileTransacted`, `RollbackTransaction`.  
- **Mismatched section and file:** Section objects that have no matching on-disk file.  
- **Suspended processes + unusual memory sections:** Suspicious section mappings after suspended process creation.  
- **Memory image mismatch:** The PE image in memory does not match the on-disk file of the process.
