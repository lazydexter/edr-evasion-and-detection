# Transacted Hollowing

## ðŸ“Œ What is Transacted Hollowing?

Transacted Hollowing is an advanced code injection technique that combines **process hollowing** with **Transactional NTFS (TxF)** to achieve stealth. It allows attackers to:

* Start a legitimate process in suspended mode.
* Hollow out (unmap) the original code sections.
* Map a malicious PE file (from a transacted file) into the process memory.
* Roll back the transaction, leaving no malicious file on disk.
* Resume the process so it executes attacker-controlled code while appearing legitimate.

## ðŸš€ Execution Flow

```
[SUSPENDED PROCESS: legit.exe loaded â†’ base image points to legit.exe file]
       â†“ hollowing
[Original base image unmapped or cleared]
       â†“ section mapping
[Malicious PE section object (TxF) mapped into process]
       â†“
[Process resumes, runs attacker code]
```



## âš¡ Detection Logic Samples


* **Hunting tip:** Look for processes where `CreateTransaction` + `CreateFileTransacted` + `NtCreateSection` + `RollbackTransaction` happen in sequence with no file left on disk.
