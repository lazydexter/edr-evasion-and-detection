# ðŸ§µ Native API Injection

## ðŸ§  What is it?

Most security tools monitor common Windows APIs like `CreateRemoteThread` or `VirtualAlloc`.

But attackers can bypass these by using **lower-level "Native APIs"** like `NtWriteVirtualMemory` and `NtCreateThreadEx`, which talk directly to Windows' core â€” and are often **not monitored as closely**.

> Itâ€™s like speaking directly to the kernel instead of going through reception. No one notices unless theyâ€™re specifically watching.

## âœ… Simple Explanation

- Instead of using the usual APIs (which are noisy and visible), attackers resolve the **"Nt" APIs** dynamically.
- They **inject malicious code into a process** using these raw APIs â€” often avoiding detection by EDRs.

## ðŸ§ª Real-World Behavior

```cpp
// Instead of CreateRemoteThread:
NtCreateThreadEx(...); 

// Instead of WriteProcessMemory:
NtWriteVirtualMemory(...);


## KQL:

DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("NtCreateThreadEx", "NtWriteVirtualMemory")
