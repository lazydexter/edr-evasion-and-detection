# ðŸ’£ Shellcode Encryption

## ðŸ§  What is it?

Attackers use small pieces of code called **shellcode** to take control of a system. But writing that code clearly in a file will get flagged by antivirus.

So instead, they:
- ðŸ”’ Encrypt the shellcode
- ðŸ”“ Decrypt it only at runtime â€” inside memory (RAM)

> It's like hiding a knife in your backpack, only taking it out once you're inside the building â€” so metal detectors donâ€™t catch it.

---

## âœ… Example

The attacker encrypts the shellcode using `XOR` or `AES`, and decrypts it in RAM like this:

```cpp
char encryptedShellcode[] = {...};  // XOR encrypted
Decrypt(encryptedShellcode);
VirtualAlloc(...)                   // Allocate memory
memcpy(...)                         // Copy decrypted shellcode
CreateThread(...)                   // Run it
